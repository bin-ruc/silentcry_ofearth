    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Silent Cry of Earth</strong> was born out of the realization that our planet’s cries often go unheard. 
      This initiative is dedicated to spreading awareness and inspiring simple yet impactful acts that restore balance between humanity and nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our vision is a world where everyone contributes — through cleanup efforts, awareness videos, and eco-friendly habits. 
      We believe that even one small action can create ripples of change.
