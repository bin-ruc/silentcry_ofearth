    <h2 class="handwritten">About Us 💚</h2>
    <p>SilentCry of Earth is a community project that encourages people to take real action to help the environment while earning verified volunteer hours.</p>
    <p>💚 This program matters because small changes — like picking up trash, planting trees, or saving water — can create a much bigger impact when shared with others.</p>
    <p>🌎 Many people already do good things for the planet but don’t record or spread awareness, which limits how much change we can make together.</p>
    <p>📸 By showing your actions through short videos, you help inspire others and build a community that truly makes a difference.</p>
    <p>✨ Our goal is to help you protect the environment while reaching a wider audience and creating lasting change. That’s what we’re all about: making small changes grow into big ones — but it can only go big WITH YOUR help 🫶.</p>
    <p>Make sure to share this page with all your friends and tell them to help the environment, sending a small clip of their deed. Small steps lead to big changes 🪜. PEACEFUL REMINDER: you can always help us make more reels, posts, as much as you want and volunteer over and over. Even when you don’t need volunteer hours, make sure to help us out, the environment, and people all around you 😊🫟</p>
