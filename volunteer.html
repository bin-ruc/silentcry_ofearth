  <p>
    That’s what we’re all about — here to make small changes grow big, but only WITH YOUR help 🫶. 
    Make sure to share this page with friends and tell them to help the environment and send a small clip of their deeds. 
    Small steps lead to big changes 🪜. PEACEFUL REMINDER: you can always help us make more reels, posts, as much as you want and volunteer over and over. 
    Even if you don’t need volunteer hours, help us out and the environment and people all around you 😊🫟
